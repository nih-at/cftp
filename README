This is Comfortable FTP, a full screen ftp client.

For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'; for
documentation read the info file `cftp.info'.  For key bindings, see
the file `bindings.desc'.

In cftp, press H for help.

The texinfo documentation is a mess; any help most welcome (especially
the outline of a good structure).

If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
