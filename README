This is Comfortable FTP, a full screen ftp client.

For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'; for
documentation read the info file `cftp.info'.

The texinfo documentation is a mess; any help most welcome (especially
the outline of a good structure).

If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
	ftp.giga.or.at /pub/nih/cftp
	http://ftp.giga.or.at/pub/nih/cftp
The latest version can always be found there.

Mail suggestions and bug reports to <dillo@giga.or.at>.
