This is Comfortable FTP, a full screen ftp client.

Supported are FTP both with active and passive data connections,
IPv4 and IPv6, and SFTP (a file transfer protocol using SSH for
authorization and connection encryption).

SFTP support is somewhat preliminary: It requires SSH protocol
version 2 with a configured sftp subsystem on the server.  Also,
interrupting transfers doesn't work.

For generic installation instructions, see file [INSTALL](INSTALL); for
documentation read the info file `cftp.info`.  For key bindings, see
the file `bindings.desc`.

In cftp, press `H` for help.

The texinfo documentation is a mess; any help most welcome
(especially the outline of a good structure).

If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
