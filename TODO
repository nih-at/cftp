! non-GPL getopt_long and tparam replacment
! time out in ftp_gets
+ option -i: don't load listing before download
! sftp: lost connection during download causes tight loop
! tagging segfaults on linux
! sorting by data segfaults on empty directories
! abort doesn't work
! stop when local disk is full during download
! core dump when sorting empty directory by date
! core dump when scrolling on NetBSD-6
+ option: maximum transfer rate
+ display transfer rate at end of transfer
+ fix buffer overflows
+ sftp: ^c kills ssh subprocess (how to avoid?!)
+ test ftp_cat error cases
+ recursive get
- move ftp_gets to util.c and rename
- move history from ftp.c
- add function comments
- build failure on OSF 5.1 (struct addrinfo declared)
- ctrl-s ctrl-s: re-use last search string

* save current url as alias to .cftprc
* ftp.univie.ac.at: abort hoses connection state
* sftp options: ssh command & flags, sftp server filename
* declare replacement functions (to avoid warnings)
* find bug when viewing or piping rfc-index.txt
* host specific rc file sections
* run time disabling of IPv6
* use mkhoststr in show-url
* rewrite parse_url
* fix REFERENCES and include in dist
* fix -Wall warnings (option and function array, termcap functions, getopt.c)
* fix compile on HPUX (struct sockaddr)
* get-tags: recoginze global failure (e. g. connection lost) and abort
* feature recognition and handling
* complete getaddrinfo replacement
* check warnings on NextSTEP
* note that building on NextSTEP requires -posix in CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
* fix unix directory parsing (ftp://ftp.deva.net/)
* rethink directory format auto detection logic
* improve check wheter lib{socket,nsl,resolv} are needed
* ^[[O triggers bindings for left and O
* ftp_retr: check 150 format on different servers
* handle 8 bit keys
* <local> mode
* decent documentation
* segfault while tagging on GNU/Linux
* try again if connect/login fails
* cwd: if path does not exist and ends with `/', it is tried twice
